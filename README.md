Thermostat Challenge
==================

Brief Summary of Approach
-------
We paired this week as we began Javascript.  After 2 hours I was very confused and moved over to Codecademy to learn before finding that targetted at new coders, whereas I had a reasonably decent framework with which to build javascript knowledge on.  I also realised I'd only been learning 2 hours and needed to be less harsh on myself.
We first learned to do FizzBuzz in JS, which helped to grasp some of the basic similarities and differences between Ruby and JS.

Points for development:
* CSS for the web page

Instructions
-------
* Clone this repository
* cd thermostat
* run "open index.html"

Specification:
--------
Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
You can increase the temperature with an up function
You can decrease the temperature with a down function
The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
Power saving mode is on by default
You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
(In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.) - to be done

Technologies Used:
--------
* Jasmine
* Open Weather API
* JQuery
* HTML
